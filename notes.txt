    Managing node versions:

      Check current version on use:

        node -v

      List all versions available on your computer:

        nvm ls

      Switch to another version:

        nvm use <version number or version name>

        ex: nvm use 12.6.0, or nvm use stable

      => So in this OmniStack Week 11, Diego uses Node 12.


    Basic Terminal commands used now by me:

      rm -R node_modules (to get rid of the install made with the wrong Node version)
      rm package.json (to get rid of the install made with the wrong Node version)
      rm package-lock.json (to get rid of the install made with the wrong Node version)

    Finally, create a .gitignore file that includes node_modules:

      echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore

      .gitignore file won't apper in a simple 'ls' command on yout Terminal. To see it run: 'ls -a'
      Visual Studio Code may show you those kind of files. But is most people don't trust that much on this.

    Now we are good and using node 12.

    Starting!

      0.1: The Package.json file:

            _omnistack-week - 3/backend (dev) $ npm init -y

      0.2: Frameworks:

            Express (helps on Routes and Parameters)
            It's a micro-framework (just a few features)

            _omnistack-week - 3/backend (dev) $ npm install express      

      1.0: backend/index.js

            const express = require('express');

            const app = express();

            app.get('/',  (request, response) => {
              return response.send('Hello World')
            })

            app.listen(3333);

      2.0: At the Terminal, run the file:

            node index.js

      3.0: At the browser, open the URL:

            http://localhost:3333/


      Done!

    * Create React App

      npx create-react-app frontend:

      _omnistack-week - 3 (dev) $ npx create-react-app frontend

      _omnistack-week - 3/frontend (dev) $ npm start
      

    At the browser, it opens by itself:
